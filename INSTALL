Prerequisites
-------------

You will need to have the Coq proof assistant (>= 8.1) with a Reals theory
compiled in.

The .tar.gz file is distributed with a working set of configure files. They
are not in the CVS repository though. Consequently, if you are building from
CVS, you will need autoconf (>= 2.59) and automake (>= 1.8).


Configuring, compiling and installing
-------------------------------------

Ideally, you should just have to type:

  $ ./configure && make

The environment variable "COQC" can be set to the Coq compiler command; the
configure script defaults to "coqc". The option "--datadir=DIR" can be set to
the directory where the compiled library files should be installed by "make
install".
