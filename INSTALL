Prerequisites
-------------

You will need to have the Coq proof assistant (>= 8.0) with a Reals theory
compiled in. If you are using version 8.1 at least and are interested in
faster proof checking, you may want to replace the definition of the
"finalize" tactic in "Gappa_library.v" by:

  Ltac finalize := exact_no_check (refl_equal true).

The .tar.gz file is distributed with a working set of configure files. They
are not in the CVS repository though. Consequently, if you are building from
CVS, you will need autoconf (>= 2.59) and automake (>= 1.8).


Configuring, compiling and installing
-------------------------------------

Ideally, you should just have to type:

  $ ./configure && make

The option "--with-coqc=PATH" can be set to the location of the "coqc" Coq
compiler. The option "--datadir=DIR" can be set to the directory where the
compiled library files should be installed by "make install".
